An unintended consequence of last week’s hair-splitting over Bharat and India was the entry of ‘endonym’ and ‘exonym’ into the country’s political vocabulary. In plain language, endonym is synonymous with a name given to itself by a community, while exonym refers to the name outsiders use to describe the group. Bharat is how the country is referred to in our national anthem. Rabindranath Tagore wrote the song in Sanskritised Bangla, but his reference to Bharat Bhagya Vidhata didn’t require any explanation because to most of the people, speaking most of the languages that find place in the currency notes issued by the Reserve Bank, Bharat is the endonym.",R.drawable.img1));

The slogan ‘One nation, one election’ is being tom-tommed. This is not the first time the BJP has made such a proposal, but for the first time it may actually have the votes, provided some regional parties lend a hand.I agree that simultaneous state elections are desirable. But they should not be clubbed with a general election. Simultaneous state elections should be held two and a half years after a general election. This will be somewhat similar to mid-term Congressional elections in the US. Voters should not have to wait a full five years to express dissatisfaction — they deserve a chance every two and a half years. That is why the slogan should be ‘One nation, two elections’.",R.drawable.img1));
        arrayList.add(new modal("Maybe creativity is overrated – A more useful ethic would centre on mundane work","Creativity is an excellent thing to aspire to, most of us would agree. Self-help books, TED talks, corporate memoirs all talk up the value of creativity. It’s no longer seen as the preserve of artists and geniuses, but as a wellspring we can all tap into, in all types of work, in engineering and management, in schooling and parenting and cooking, in living well.But what is creativity? Originality? Ingenuity? Divergent thinking? Far from being an eternal value, it is a foggy idea, a word that only came into popular use in 1950s America amid Cold War anxieties about conformity and falling behind in technology, says The Cult of Creativity: A Surprisingly Recent History by Samuel W Franklin.Of course humans have an urge to make things, and an appetite for novelty. But the idea of a trait called creativity is a recent invention. It replaced the older Romantic idea of the ‘mad genius’, which was both a gift and an affliction for those who had it. Creativity was a more democratic idea, accessible to all, and it suggests health and vitality.In post-war America, creativity was cast as the force of individualism, and it had both anti-communist and aspirational uses. If the Soviets were improving their technology by blueprint, Americans had ingenuity, they claimed. Psychologists, engineers and advertisers embraced for their own ends. Corporations introduced techniques like ‘brainstorming’, with ‘freewheeling’ sessions where good ideas could be generated by committee. In classrooms, creativity was taught as a kind of general ability, an overarching attitude.These were the decades when it was common to map political beliefs and systems onto personality types.Creativity was cast as an individual signature and a democratic value, the ability to live with some disorder in free societies, compared to the totalitarian systems that suppressed human impulse for the sake of stability and unity. But it was, and remains, a catchall term that people use for things they like, rather than any specific quality. The definitional ambiguity has helped it endure, and spread without question, the book explains.The uses of creativity have only multiplied in ‘post-industrial’ economies, which are supposedly no longer about making things in factories but having brilliant ideas. Today, as AI’s abilities threaten to supplant human workers, there is even greater insistence on creativity, as the very thing that machines can’t do. Creativity is packaged and sold as a product, as ‘design thinking’, for instance. Neuroscience and its applications promise to identify, quantify and maximise it.The book calls for a closer examination of what we label creativity, because there is no such pure spirit to be found. For instance, when it comes to accomplishing something, what matters is not some elusive inspiration but motivation, persistence, and the time and space to do it. Secondly, it might be helpful to look at the value of what’s been created rather than its novelty. The cult of innovation and disruption has caused climate catastrophe and tech-driven chaos. Rather than glorifying change and newness, a more useful ethic could revolve around care and maintenance.We could value the work done by nurses, janitors, most engineers, garbage collectors and so on, mundane and essential work that keeps the world from falling apart. The opposite of destruction is perhaps not creation, but preservation, suggests the book.",R.drawable.img1));
        arrayList.add(new modal("G20: Over the moon and behind the marigolds","The Indian manual of makeovers has some explicit instructions when it comes to beautifying our homes for celebrations. It advocates the Quick Gun Murugan method of décor. A dent in the wall? Cover it with strings of marigolds. Mouldy, damp patch by the door? Forget waterproofing; hang a gota curtain over it. It has always been evident that we are not particularly bothered by what we see every day but are preoccupied by what all the Sharmajis of the world will think of our homes.The G20 summit prep team is clearly following this manual. What can be cleaned has been scrubbed to a gleaming finish, and what can’t, is hidden behind a heap of posters, screens, and flowers.We do deserve to have a big, fat celebration after our grand Chandrayaan-3 success. In fact, Isro chief S Somanath has been getting accolades both on earth and in the skies. When he boarded a recent IndiGo flight, the air hostess made an in-flight announcement calling him a national hero. What was even more remarkable was the fact that he got free nuts with their dehydrated poha.The moon mission has been a great source of pride with street parties to entire housing societies hosting Chandrayaan soirees. There has been so much chatter about it on my building WhatsApp group, that one neighbour (who I now suspect to be a Chinese spy, though he keeps insisting he is from Rajkot) called the mission ‘Chandrayawn.’ I wanted to cover his car in mud, but I did something equally spiteful: I immediately threw him out of the group. No more lovely ‘Good morning’ and ‘Happy Sunday’ forwards for him.There is another extraordinary thing about the lunar mission that speaks to every Indian’s heart: its bargain price. The Chandrayaan-3 operation reportedly cost less than half the budget of the movie ‘Interstellar’. This has made all the bhaisaabs who jump at the sight of two-for-one bonanza offers rejoice even more. Getting a good deal is a large part of our inherent makeup. For the India vs Pakistan ODI world cup clash in Ahmedabad, people came up with an ingenious plan to deal with inflated hotel room prices: they booked hospital rooms instead. This way they pay cheaper rates for their stay and get a medical check-up simultaneously.Meanwhile, the G20 dinner invitation from the ‘President of Bharat’ caused frothing anchors and irate panellists to get into heated discussions over rumours of a name change. The opposition alliance, with the acronym I.N.D.I.A., also jumped into the fray. And some joked that Pakistan was not just getting its cricketers ready, but also planning a googly by laying claim to the name ‘India’ if we renounce it officially.Now I am the last one to take umbrage at any name, which would be obvious by the fact that I have been lugging ‘Twinkle’ around for almost five decades. However, for members of my generation, the definitive image that the word ‘Bharat’ brings to mind is the iconic Manoj Kumar with a pained expression and a hand covering half of his face.It would be interesting if the electoral Kurukshetra of 2024 does turn out to be a battle between Bharat and INDIA. But who are the Kauravas and who are the Pandavas in this Mahabharata will all depend on which way you lean, especially if it’s to the left of the right side.Another leader skipping the G20 band baaja baraat along with Vladimir Putin is Chinese President Xi Jinping. This has nothing to do with being confused between India and Bharat, as I am sure my building spy would have explained these things to the Chinese government. There are strong rumours that Xi Jinping had been very excited to attend the summit earlier when he mistook videos of Rahul Gandhi and our Laluji cooking mutton as part of the G20 banquet preparations. Clearly, dal bati churma is not going to cut it for someone from a country that may not play cricket but considers it an edible dish instead.My fellow citizens are not perturbed by Xi Jinping’s absence: the only Chinese they truly care about is the kind that comes in takeaway containers. WhatsApp groups around the country continue to be over the moon at the idea of the G20 summit. My bua in Chanakyapuri, instead of complaining about road diversions or the restrictions on food deliveries during the summit, is busy posting updates of what she calls, ‘Our country being right up there with all the first world countries.They used to say that all roads lead to Rome but with roads temporarily closed as world leaders arrived for the summit, it’s clear that all flight routes lead only to Delhi.",R.drawable.img1));
        arrayList.add(new modal("‘One planet, One people’ is a Sanatan ideal","Sanatan dharma is the homage of divinity to itself. It is sanatan, eternal, for not being static and for its ability to become new again, as per the Atharva Ved, X.8.2. As a sage puts it, ‘Sada bhavah sanatanah. Sanatana karoti iti sanatanayati. Sanatanayatiti sanatanah. Sanatanashchasau dharma iti sanatano dharmah,’ meaning, ‘That which is always existent is sanatan; that which causes one to become sanatan is also sanatan. That which is sanatan and dharma is sanatan dharma.’Dharma is not a set of dogmas but the embodiment of higher values of life, enunciated and vouchsafed from time to time. It is the way to abhyudaya, worldly excellence, and nihshreyasa, spiritual fulfilment. Derived from the root ‘dhri’ which means ‘to uphold, support’, it connotes both the moral law and the law of one’s being. In its highest aspect, dharma is truth itself.To adopt truthfulness in life, abide by the laws of nature, see divinity in everything around, and to stay whole in mind, body and spirit, are age-old ideas of sanatan dharma, which continue to be relevant. Spirituality, its core aspect, provides the cosmic vision that one’s good lies in the good of the other.The Vedic insight that there is one unchanging reality appearing as many; that consciousness is the substratum of matter, mind, and all else that exists; that the microcosm contains in it the macrocosm, provided a new vision to scientists like Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrodinger, Werner Heisenberg, and David Joseph Bohm, among others.In his Preface to The Tao of Physics, Fritzof Capra mentions that in meditative moments, he saw ‘cascades of energy coming down from outer space, in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses’. He envisioned ‘the atoms of the elements’ and those of his body ‘participating in the cosmic dance of energy’, and proclaimed that the phenomena was indeed the dance of Shiv.Sanatan dharma, in its popular form as Hinduism, cannot be assessed strictly in terms of concepts applicable to other faiths that started in historical time and have a single scripture, a codified set of beliefs and practices, an ecclesiastical body. It has a great cellular potential to generate any type or number of ideological tissues in its body, each pluripotent to create its prototypes, and right in its own way.There have been periods of twilight in its history, but never was light totally eclipsed from view. With its corrective mechanism, it has endeavoured to separate primeval truths from accretions that cluster around an organism as time passes by.Sanatan dharma goads one ‘to move from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, from death to immortality’. There is no place in it for heresy or blasphemy, no tradition of crusades, no bifurcation of humanity into the faithful and the unfaithful, no clash with science or with other faiths, as truth can be expressed in a million ways.The slogan, ‘One planet, One people’ is an echo of the sanatan dharma ideal, vasudhaiva kutumbakam, meaning, the whole mankind is one family. The Vedic prayer : Saha na vavatu, saha nau bhunaktu, sahaviryam karavavahai – Let us learn together. Let us enjoy the fruits of our knowledge together. Let us get strengthened together – can script the unity principle among different communities and faiths.",R.drawable.img1));

The term began to gain traction in the 1990s when East Asia was the lodestar for economists seeking a universal template to crank up the pace of economic growth.Asia today is the world’s primary economic growth engine and home to the largest middle class. Three of the five biggest economies today are in Asia.It’s not just economic competitiveness that leads to the label. Cultural richness stemming from being home to three of the four oldest river valley civilisations is complemented by contemporary Asia’s global impact on popular culture and food. Yet, there remain sceptics. One argument questions the very notion, arguing that Asia is not a natural bloc but more a creation of European geographers.Between central Asian republics and East Asian ‘tiger economies’, there’s not much of an overlap. But the more serious critique isolates factors beyond economics. Advocates of this argument say that if the 20th century was the American one, it was not just because of its economy or Hollywood. Bretton Woods is not just an American location. It represents the hegemony that shaped institutions of global governance.Where is Asia’s influence? There’s no clear answer now. Modi’s speech called for the need to build a rules-based order. The remarks were directed against China, which may be the only strategic rival to the US but faces a big pushback to its leadership in Asia.In other words, Asia itself represents a battlefield of ideas. It’s the world’s most economically dynamic region, with deep integration through trade. But ‘Asian century’ is nowhere near being a done deal.",R.drawable.img1));
